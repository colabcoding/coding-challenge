Hello @msandra#5783 @Fawkes#2801 @mvrck#8858 @apollo#6091 @Raihan#0127 @Jonathan Sugianto#1498 @hikaru#2636, I got you a coding challenge. Please watch the video of the program you need to recreate. Change Interpreter in Thonny to Python (instead of Micropython ESP8266) . Some guide to get you started will be provided. 

Here are some rules:
1. You may use any python techniques to recreate the program
2. Each of you own 3 cards. Use the card to ask question to me. When cards are used, you should look for the answer from the internet
3. Duration to complete the project is 1 (one) week starting from Saturday, 20 Aug - 27 Aug. It is allowed if you begin now for a head start.
